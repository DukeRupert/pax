## What is a VPN, Really?

Think of a VPN like a private tunnel through the internet. When you're away from home and want to check your security cameras, you need a secure way to reach them. A VPN creates an encrypted connection directly to your home network, making it as if you were sitting in your living room using your home WiFi.

## Why Not Just Use Remote Access Apps?

Many camera systems offer their own remote viewing apps, but this convenience comes with a privacy trade-off. When using these apps, your video feeds often travel through the manufacturer's servers. This means you're trusting not just the camera company, but also whoever hosts their cloud services, with your private security footage.

## The Self-Hosted Advantage

This is why we set up a personal VPN server on your home network. Instead of relying on third-party services, your VPN creates a direct, encrypted connection to your home. This means:
- Your security footage never passes through anyone else's servers
- You maintain complete control over who can access your system
- There's no monthly subscription fee for remote access
- Your connection is as secure as your home network

## Aren't Commercial VPN Services the Same Thing?

There's a common misconception here. Commercial VPN services (the ones you see advertised everywhere) serve a different purpose. They route your internet traffic through their servers, which means you're just shifting trust from your internet provider to the VPN company. For accessing your home security system, you want a personal VPN that connects directly to your home network.

## Our Implementation

We install and configure a professional-grade VPN server on your network that:
- Runs on your own hardware, under your control
- Provides secure access to authorized devices only
- Requires no ongoing subscription fees
- Maintains your privacy by keeping connections in-house

When you need to check your cameras remotely, you'll use a simple app on your phone or computer to connect to your home VPN. Once connected, you can securely access your cameras as if you were at home.

## Simple, Secure, and Private

The beauty of this approach is that once it's set up, it just works. You don't have to worry about who might be accessing your cameras or where your footage is being stored. Your private security system stays private, accessible only to those you trust.
