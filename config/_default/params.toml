[faq]
title = "Frequently Asked Questions"

[[faq.items]]
question = "Why are your systems more expensive upfront than traditional security companies?"
answer = "Unlike traditional companies that charge lower upfront costs but lock you into expensive long-term contracts, our systems are owned by you outright. This means no monthly fees, no contracts, and complete control over your security system. Learn more in our article: <a href='/posts/traditional-security-company-drawbacks' class='text-sky-600'>Why Traditional Security Companies May Not Be Your Best Option</a>"

[[faq.items]]
question = "How do I access my security cameras when I'm away from home?"
answer = "We set up a secure, self-hosted VPN that allows you to access your cameras as if you were at home - without relying on third-party services or exposing your footage to outside servers. Read more about our approach in <a href='/posts/secure-home-vpn-access' class='text-sky-600'>Understanding VPNs: Your Private Path Home</a>"

[[faq.items]]
question = "Why do you put security cameras on a separate network?"
answer = "Isolating cameras on their own network segment is a crucial security measure that protects your home network from potential vulnerabilities. This means even if a camera was compromised, it couldn't access your personal devices. Find out more in our article: <a href='/posts/network-security-home-surveillance-systems' class='text-sky-600'>Why Network Security Matters for Your Home Surveillance System</a>"

[[faq.items]]
question = "Do I need to trust the camera manufacturer?"
answer = "No - our network security setup means you don't have to trust the camera manufacturer. By isolating cameras and blocking their internet access, we prevent them from sending any data to outside servers, regardless of what the manufacturer might attempt."

[[faq.items]]
question = "What happens if my internet goes down?"
answer = "Your security system continues to function normally, recording to your local NVR (Network Video Recorder). You'll only lose remote access until your internet is restored. This is another advantage of our self-contained system approach."

[[faq.items]]
question = "How long do you maintain support for installed systems?"
answer = "We provide ongoing support for all installed systems, including security updates and troubleshooting. Since you own the equipment outright, there are no contract limitations on support duration. We charge only for parts and labor when needed."

[[faq.items]]
question = "Can I integrate this system with my smart home devices?"
answer = "Yes, but we implement it securely. We can integrate your security system with authorized smart home devices while maintaining proper network segregation to ensure security. We'll work with you to balance convenience and security based on your needs."
